Schedulability
==============
*************************
What is Schedulability?
*************************
Schedulability is a tools group works in Unix System, developed with
the propose of the low power consumption for real time systems.
The input is a task model and output is if the task model is scalable or not.
Performs various scalability test for to discover if is scalable.
It works for various processors or clusters.
Uses the technique DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling).
Determines optimal frequency on systems through an exhaustive search.
The compiled in this package created other two tools: the SCHEDTESTS and PSEUDOSIM.
Schedtests works with task models fixed and pseudosim works with models random.

**********************************
What is the use of Schedulability?
**********************************
Schedulability is useful for discover if a task model is scalable or not.
Determines optimal frequency on systems with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
Can be used for real time systems designers, the project of real time systems
can be facilitated, case the target system contains a processor with functionality
DVFS.
Is useful for measuring power consumption.
